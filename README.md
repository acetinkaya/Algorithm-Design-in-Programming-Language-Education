Abstract:

The field of algorithm development on computer systems continues to grow in importance in today’s world, highlighting the critical nature of algorithm design and implementation. With the increasing diversity of algorithm use cases, it is essential to emphasize the significance of proper algorithm design methods for each problem. As such, the design of new and effective algorithms is of paramount importance to the continued growth and innovation of computer systems. Algorithms play a crucial role in solving problems within established systems. Therefore, it is important to detail the appropriate algorithm methods for each problem. As the areas of algorithm use become more diverse, the programming languages used in these platforms also change. This study aims to help learners understand the steps to take when designing algorithms and learning programming languages, regardless of the language used. Common algorithm designs are demonstrated on Python, C, C++, and C# programming languages. These designs cover shared concepts across all four languages and will aid in coding on these programming languages. The goal is to learn and apply algorithm design on multiple programming languages. This study covers the basics of algorithms, programming, programming concepts, and the fundamentals of computer programming. It is essential to understand these topics in programming language education in order to correctly and error-free install algorithms, helping newcomers to the software industry take the correct steps.
